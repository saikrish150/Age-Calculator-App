# Age-Calculator-App
An age calculator app is a mobile application designed to calculate the age of a person based on their date of birth. The app is typically used to quickly determine a person's age in years, months, and days.
The age calculator app typically requires the user to input their date of birth in the app's interface. Once the date of birth is entered, the app calculates the age of the person based on the current date.
The user interface of an age calculator app is usually simple and easy to use. The app typically has a single screen where the user inputs their date of birth and the app displays their age.
Age calculator apps can be useful in a variety of situations. For example, parents can use the app to calculate the age of their child, teachers can use the app to calculate the age of their students, and event organizers can use the app to calculate the age of attendees.
